# 🔥 THERMAL NIGHT VISION FACIAL RECOGNITION & ALERT SYSTEM  

## 📌 PROJECT DESCRIPTION  

A real-time thermal detection and facial recognition system built with **YOLOv8 segmentation**, **OpenCV**, **Face Recognition library**, and a **Gradio-based live video interface**.  

This system applies a dynamic thermal effect to detected human figures, recognizes known faces from a stored database, and triggers alert sounds when unknown persons are detected.
